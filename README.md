## Overview

Notesnook is a free (as in speech) & open-source note-taking app focused on user privacy & ease of use. To ensure zero knowledge principles, Notesnook encrypts everything on your device using `XChaCha20-Poly1305` & `Argon2`.

Notesnook is our **proof** that privacy does _not_ (always) have to come at the cost of convenience. We aim to provide users peace of mind & 100% confidence that their notes are safe and secure. The decision to go fully open source is one of the most crucial steps towards that.

This repository contains all the code required to build & use the Notesnook web, desktop & mobile clients. If you are looking for a full feature list or screenshots, please check the [website](https://notesnook.com/).
